The 5V from the USB is only there when I am testing/programming the controller and don't want to use up the battery power.  During \"normal operation\" the USB connector is not connected to anything.  Does this change anything, if so why?\n",

    "    - Doesn't seem to consider where the USB signals should be placed unless they are mentioned\n",
    "    - Need to notify it that the USB connector is only for programming\n",
    "    - If I give it a lot of detail, it seems to answer parts of the question with less detail, like what should be in each layer, maybe I should ask it to be detailed like I do with chatGPT"

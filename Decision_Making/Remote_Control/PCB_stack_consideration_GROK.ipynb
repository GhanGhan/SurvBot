    "- balances performance, cost and complexity\n",
    "- **Top Layer (Signal)**\n",
    "    - used for component placments, analog (joystick) and digital (button and display) control signals \n",
    "    - will host joysticks, mode change buttons, LCD display connection and microcontroller pins\n",
    "    - analog and digital control signals need to be carefully routed to minimize noise and interference\n",
    "- **Ground Plane (Layer 2)**\n",
    "    - solid ground place directly benearth the top signal layer provides low-impedance return path for signals\n",

    "# Justification for Stackup\n",
    "1. Signal Integrity and Noise reduction\n",
    "    - Ground plane and power plane provides excellent isolation, reduces crosstalk and EMI between the analog, digital and communication (bluetooth) signals\n",
    "    - Ground plane minizmes ground loops and proves a stable reference reference for all signals\n",
    "2. Power Managment\n",
    "    - a dedicated power plane ensures low impedance and reduces voltage ripple\n",
    "3. Size and Cost Constraints\n",
    "    - as a small handheld device, PCB needs to be compact\n",
    "    - 4 layers stack-up allows for densier routing and smaller board size compared to a 2 layer board, while remaining cost effective for volume production\n",
    "    - 6 layer or higher stack-up would be overkill for this application and increase costs unnecessarily\n",
    "4. Bluetooth and EMI considerations\n",
    "    - Bluetooth operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency range, making it susceptivle to EMI\n",
    "    - ground plane in a 4-layer stack up acts as a shield, reducing interference from other components like the LCD or joystick\n",
    "5. Manufacturability\n",
    "    - 4 layers is a standard configuration for many PCB manufacturers, ensuring good availability, cost and ease of fabrication\n",
    "    - avoids complexity and higher cost of 6+ layers while meeting the needs of this design"

    "# Additional Considerations\n",
    "- **Material:** Use FR-4 as the base material\n",
    "    - it is cost effective and widely available\n",
    "    - for 2.5 GHz Bluetooth signals, ensure the dielectric constant (Dk) and loss tangent are suitable\n",
    "        - typical FR-4 values are Dk ~4.5\n",
    "- **Thickness:** standard thickness of 1.6mm (0.062 inches) is recommended \n",
    "    - good for mehchanical stability and compatabilty with enclosures and connectors\n",
    "    - if thinner profile needed, can opt for 1.0/0.8mm, but could increase cost\n",
    "- **Impedance Control:**\n",
    "    - if high-speed signal requies a specific impedance (such as USB), work with manufacturer to calculate trace widths and spacing based on stack-up\n",
    "- **Thermal Management:**\n",
    "    - power consumption will be low, but still ensure good ground and plower plane coverage to dissipate any minor heat\n",

    "# Why Signal-GND-PWR-Signal over Signal-GND-GND-Signal\n",
    "1. **Power Distribution and Stability**\n",
    "    - Signal-GND-PWRM-Signal:\n",
    "        - dedicated power plane provides low-impedance path for power distribution\n",
    "        - stable, low-noise power delivery minimizes voltage drops and power ripples, essential for reliable components operation\n",
    "        - helps decouple power and ground, reducing noise coupling between digital and analog sections of the design\n",
    "    - Signal-GND-GND-Signal:\n",
    "        - 2 GND planes isntead of a PWR plane means you'll need to route power traces on one of the signal layers\n",
    "        - this can lead to higher impedance in power distribution, increased voltage noise, and potential intererence with signal traces, especially in a compact handheld device where space is limited\n",
    "        - routing power manually also increases the risk of crosstalk and EMI, particulary with bluetooth Antenna and analog Signals\n",
    "    - **PWR is better here** beacuse we have multiple power domains, so this ensures cleaner power delivery and simplifies PCB layout, reducin gdesign time and potential errors\n",
    "2. **Signal Integrity and Noise Isolation**\n",
    "    - Signal-GND-PWRM-Signal:\n",
    "        - the ground plane directly under the top signal layer provides an excellent reutrn path for high-frequency signals, shields analog signals, and digital noise generated by uC and other components\n",
    "        - power plane further isolates power-related niose from the bottom signal layer, ensuring both top and bottom signal layers remain relatively clearn from routing digital, communication and remaining analog traces\n",
    "    - Signal-GND-GND-Signal Stack-Up:\n",
    "        - two ground places provide robust shielding and low-impedance ground returns, they don't address power distribution effectively\n",
    "        - without a dedicated GND plane, would need to rout power on signal layers -> could introduce noise in ground planes via shared vias or traces\n",
    "        - this can degrade signal integrity, especially for analog joysticks\n"
